# Real Estate Manager Project
### Class Assignment for Programming Methodology II

## Project overview
This repository contains a C++ console program that manages real estate listings, agents, and client information using multiple classes and functions. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts while following the assignment requirements. For this assignment, no user input was required, and `main.cpp` uniquely tests the implementations.

## Features
- Used class and OOP concepts such as inheritance, composition, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Uses pointers, dynamic memory allocation (`new`/`delete`), and pointer arrays to manage objects
- Uses `static` members to maintain class-level states
- Includes array and `nullptr` checks to avoid undefined behavior or crashes
